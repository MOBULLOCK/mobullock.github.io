     <title>Apple Frangipane Tart</title>
     <ingredients>3/4 cup almond meal, 1 1/2 tbsp plain four, 1/4 cup sugar, 50g unsalted butter, 1 large egg, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 2 sheets of puff pastry, 2 to 3 apples sliced, extra butter melted and 1 tbsp sugar</ingredients>
     <directions>Preheat the oven to the 200 degrees Celsius. Place the pastries on a lined oven tray to thaw. Cut 1 sheet into 4 squares and prick all over with a fork to stop it puffing up too much and other one I choose to have it as a round circle. For frangipane filling, cream the sugar and butter together until light. Add egg and mix to combine. Finally add the almonds, extract to combine. Spread the frangipane evenly into the puff pastry sheets leaving 1 cm from the edges. Arrange the apples slices in a pretty petal pattern. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with the extra sugar. Bake for about 20-25 minutes till the pastry is puffed and golden around the edges. Drizzle with honey and serve with dollop of double cream.</directions>
